# Webpack基本使用

install Webpack and webpack-dev-server globally
```
$ npm i -g webpack@1.x webpack-dev-server@1.x
```
Some command-line options
- `webpack` – for building once for development
- `webpack -p` – for building once for production (minification)
- `webpack --watch` – for continuous incremental build
- `webpack -d` – to include source maps
- `webpack --colors` – for making things pretty
